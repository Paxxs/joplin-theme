  <b>My personal <i>userchrome.css</i> and <i>userstyles.css</i></b> for <a href="https://joplinapp.org" target="blank">Joplin</a>.
  Built upon <a href="https://github.com/amandamcg/joplin-theme" target="blank">Amanda's</a> theme (thanks for help on the forum!) and highly inspired by the <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" target="blank">Things 3 app</a> for Mac/iOS as well as some details i liked myself, and specially built to support my daily GTD (Getting Things Done) workflow. Some details about my setup below the screenshots.
